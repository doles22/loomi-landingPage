You are a senior-level product designer & front-end engineer. Please build a highly polished, responsive marketing website for a mobile app called “Loomi Stories.”

Tech stack:
- Use modern semantic HTML5, clean, readable CSS (or Tailwind CSS if preferred), and minimal vanilla JavaScript or React.
- The site should be fully responsive and look great on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Overall concept:
Loomi Stories is a cozy, modern storytelling app for families. It weaves a family’s imagination into personalized bedtime stories with simple line-art illustrations. The name “Loomi” blends “loom” (threads woven together) and “light” (warmth, spark, glow). The brand should feel warm, minimal, and emotionally connective.

Pages:
1. Main landing page (Home)
2. Privacy Policy page
3. Terms of Use page

Routing:
- Home: `/`
- Privacy Policy: `/privacy-policy`
- Terms of Use: `/terms-of-use`

Global design system:
- Aesthetic: Soft, minimal, modern, with gentle curves and lots of white space.
- Visual metaphor: Thin line art, subtle flowing “threads,” and soft glows to represent woven stories and light.
- Color palette:
  - Background: Off-white / soft cream
  - Primary accent: Warm golden light (for buttons and highlights)
  - Secondary accents: Soft charcoal for text, pale blush or muted teal for subtle highlights
- Typography:
  - Headings: Clean, modern sans-serif with slightly rounded feel
  - Body: Highly legible sans-serif
  - Use good hierarchy, line-height, and spacing to feel calm and premium.
- Imagery:
  - Use simple, single-line or minimal illustrations (abstract shapes, families reading together, a glowing thread weaving across the page).
  - Avoid noisy stock photos; keep it cohesive and art-driven.

Navigation:
Sticky top nav with:
- Logo on the left (simple “Loomi Stories” wordmark)
- Links on the right: “How it works”, “Features”, “For Families”, “Download the App”, “Privacy”, “Terms”

Include a consistent footer with:
- Small logo or wordmark
- Links: Home, Download, Privacy Policy, Terms of Use
- Copyright line: “© [CURRENT YEAR] Loomi Stories. All rights reserved.”

========================
HOME / LANDING PAGE CONTENT
========================

Goal:
Make the first fold clearly communicate:
- What Loomi Stories is
- Emotional benefit to families
- A clear call-to-action to download the app

Hero section (above the fold):
- Headline example:
  “Weave bedtime stories that bring your family closer.”
- Subheading example:
  “Loomi Stories turns your child’s ideas and your family moments into beautifully illustrated bedtime stories you can read and listen to together.”
- Primary CTA button:
  - Text: “Download on the App Store”
  - Link: https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/loomi-stories/id6754125616
- Secondary CTA (text link or ghost button):
  - “Learn how Loomi works”
- Visual:
  - On the right side (or below on mobile), show a mockup of a phone displaying a Loomi story screen with line-art illustration.
  - Add a subtle flowing line or “thread of light” moving through the hero section.

Section: “What is Loomi Stories?”
- Short paragraph explaining:
  - Loomi weaves your family’s imagination into personalized bedtime stories.
  - Children become the heroes.
  - Stories are simple, warm, and illustrated in a calming line-art style.
- Use 2–3 supporting bullet points about connection, creativity, and memories.

Section: “How it works” (3-step layout)
Use a three-column or stacked vertical layout:
1. “Add your family”  
   - “Create characters based on your kids, family members, and even pets.”
2. “Spark a story”  
   - “Start with a simple idea, memory, or bedtime prompt.”
3. “Enjoy together”  
   - “Loomi weaves it into a cozy story with matching illustrations you can read or listen to at bedtime.”

Include simple line icons or illustrations for each step.

Section: “Why families love Loomi”
- 3–4 cards that highlight:
  - “Stories about your child”: They see themselves as the hero.
  - “Moments that matter”: Turn everyday memories into stories.
  - “Calm, cozy bedtime”: Gentle narration and simple line art.
  - “A library you’ll cherish”: Save and revisit your favorite stories.

Optional: add a short testimonial-style section with fake placeholder quotes that I can replace:
- Example: “My son asks for his Loomi story every night now. It’s become our favorite bedtime ritual.”

Section: “Designed to feel calm and simple”
- Talk about the art direction:
  - Line-art illustrations inspired by a single thread
  - Minimal, distraction-free reading experience
  - Built for parents who want meaningful screen time, not noise

Section: “Get Loomi Stories”
- Strong call-to-action block:
  - Headline: “Ready to start your next story?”
  - Short text: “Join families weaving magical, meaningful bedtime stories with Loomi.”
  - Prominent App Store button:
    - “Download on the App Store”
    - Link: https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/loomi-stories/id6754125616
- Optionally include small text: “Available on iOS. Android coming soon.” (use placeholder if needed)

Make the Home page feel like a premium product marketing page for a family-focused app, with clean sections, smooth scrolling, subtle hover states, and simple animations (like fade-ins or sliding in content).

========================
PRIVACY POLICY PAGE
========================

Route: `/privacy-policy`

Create a clean, readable layout with:
- Page title: “Privacy Policy”
- Subheader: “Your family’s privacy and safety matter to us.”
- Use placeholder legal-style sections with headings such as:
  - Information We Collect
  - How We Use Your Information
  - How We Store and Protect Data
  - Children’s Privacy
  - Your Rights and Choices
  - Contact Us

Use simple placeholder text I can replace later. Focus on good typography, spacing, and readability (larger line height, soft text color, left-aligned text).

Include a “Back to Home” link and “Download the App” button somewhere near the top or bottom.

========================
TERMS OF USE PAGE
========================

Route: `/terms-of-use`

Create a clean, readable layout with:
- Page title: “Terms of Use”
- Subheader: “Please read these terms carefully before using Loomi Stories.”
- Placeholder sections:
  - Acceptance of Terms
  - Use of the Service
  - Subscription and Payments
  - Content and Ownership
  - Limitations of Liability
  - Termination
  - Changes to These Terms
  - Contact Information

Again, focus on clean typography and structure, with placeholder text that I will replace with my own legal terms.

Include a “Back to Home” link and “Download the App” button.

========================
GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
========================

- Fully responsive, mobile-first design.
- Smooth scroll for anchor links (e.g., “How it works” from nav).
- Consistent spacing, padding, and component style across all pages.
- Accessible color contrast and ARIA labels where appropriate.
- Clean, well-commented code so I can easily edit text and links later.

Please output the complete code for the site (HTML/CSS/JS or React/Tailwind) so I can copy it into Replit and run it as a multi-page site or a single-page app with routing.
